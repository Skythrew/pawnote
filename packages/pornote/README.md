Unofficial client for [Pronote](https://www.index-education.com/fr/logiciel-gestion-vie-scolaire.php)
including many features such as...

- [x] Offline access thanks to `vite-plugin-pwa`.
- [x] Multi-accounts stored under unique *slugs* locally.
- [x] Local save of endpoints for each account - with `localForage`.
- [x] Speed and performance under the hood thanks to [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com)' reactivity.
- [x] ENT support without having to open new tabs everywhere.

## Warning

This project is made for educational purposes.
That means that the project will not really be maintained in long terms.

You can use this client to do basic tasks
like watching your timetable, homeworks, etc...

Just don't **currently** use this client for very specific
tasks such as doing a quizz, upload a file and things like that.

## Alternatives

- [Pronote+ / Papillon](https://github.com/PapillonApp/Papillon)

## Ressources

Without these very useful ressources, I wouldn't be able to write this whole client by myself.
