## Warning

You can use this client to do basic tasks
like watching your timetable, homeworks, etc...

Just don't **currently** use this client for very specific
tasks such as uploading a file and things like that.

## Ressources

Without these very useful ressources, I wouldn't be able to write this whole client by myself.
