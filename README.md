## Warning

This project is made for educationnal purposes.
That means that the project will not really be
maintained. You can still use this app, to do
everyday tasks, but when it comes to start a quiz,
or record yourself, or whatever that isn't in the
`Features` part, you should use the **real** Pronote
application. Note that **Index-Education** can take down
this project at anytime.
